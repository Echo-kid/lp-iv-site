        <h1 id="bingo-game">Bingo</h1>
        <p><a href="Bingo.html" >Here</a> is a very rudementary bingo game i made in Javascript. I made it as i learned, so it's a bit rough. I'd 
            like to add other players and maybe a script to alert you that you have a bingo when you have 5 squares 
            selected.

        <h1 id="pocket-calculator">Soviet Calculator</h1>
        <p><a href="javascript: void(0);" id="calc-link" onClick="calcWindow();">Here</a> is a basic calculator in Javascript. It definitely needs
            some work but it's mostly there.

        <script>
            function calcWindow() {
                let sovietCalc = window.open("calculator.html", "calculator", "width=320,height=600,top=500,left=500");
