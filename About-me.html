                Hi! My name is Lockett and I currently live in the Buckhead area of Atlanta (very close to ATV actually).
                 I've been self employed for the last 16 years as a musician and partner in a touring group.
                  I've had an incredible journey all over the world and I've been extremely fortunate to do it as a career.
                   I'm a father of 2 girls and looking for new ways to both, be home more and gain skills outside
                    of music, which is all I have known in my adult life. I initially started messing around with html/css 
                    from a few online classes and found I really enjoyed it. I branched out into python and some bash stuff 
                    (and now JavaScript) and here I am! I'm still very new to this and I'm very excited/nervous to begin this
                     journey with you all!
            </p>
